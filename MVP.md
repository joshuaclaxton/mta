Description
-  I have created a time series graph of the daily entries in Broadway Junction over the course of the spring and early summer of 2019. I intend to depict the foot traffic of one of the major stations in one of the most policed areas in Brooklyn. Given the correlation between poverty, police presence/arrests, and fare evasion in the area, I intend to explore opportunities for reduced fares or fare-less rides from the station during certain days of the week or over a specified time period. The social experiment could serve as a policy consideration. If that net loss in revenue to the MTA is minimal enough, it may be a reasonable policy. Thus, it is important to know the revenue generated by the current foot traffic to asses the impact of a program that could otherwise be very beneficial to the community.
